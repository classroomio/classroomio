# Gitpod Setup

## One Click Setup

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/rotimi-best/classroomio)

<Callout title="Note">
  Gitpod does not utilize `localhost` for accessing services. Instead, it uses its own URL after
  starting all the necessary services. The correct URLs to access the project are automatically
  inserted into the `.env` file upon initialization.

### Viewing URLs in Terminals

To view the URLs, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal.
2. Click on the `port` to see the URLs.
