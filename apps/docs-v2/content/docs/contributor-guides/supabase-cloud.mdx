## Step by Step Guide

<Steps>
<Step>
### Create a Supabase project

For this step you need to have signed up for supabase and create an account, just visit [supabase.com](https://supabase.com).

Once you have an account just click on the _New Project_ on your dashboard. After that you should see a similar screen to the below, fill in the fields.

<Callout title="Important">
  Make sure you save your database password somewhere, else you won't be able to get it back
  anywhere in the dashboard for security reasons.
</Callout>

</Step>

<Step>
### Setup Supabase CLI

Follow the instructions [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/local-development/cli/getting-started) to setup the Supabase CLI on your computer.

</Step>

<Step>
### Login to Supabase via the CLI

Open your terminal and go to the root of the project. Run the following:

```bash
supabase login
```

Follow the instruction in your terminal to generate your access token. Paste the token in the console and hit **Enter**

</Step>

<Step>
### Push migrations to your Supabase project

- Go to the supabase dashboard, go to your project, click on the settings icon on the left side bar

![DB URL in the supabase dashboard](/db-url.webp)

- Copy the URL in the image above for your `db url`
- Paste it somewhere
- In the url, replace `[YOUR PASSWORD]` with your db password (which you saved in section 1).
- Then run in your terminal:

```bash
supabase db push --db-url "URL HERE"
```

<Callout title="Important">
  Make sure you preserve the double quotes before and after the url. Only replace `URL HERE` with
  your `db url` that contains your password
</Callout>

#### Result

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure Auth in your Supabase project

Here we will update our email configurations, to prevent supabase from sending confirmation emails on signup. This is because we don't use Supabase for email verification, we handle that internally due to the quality of the email.

</Step>

<Step>
### Configure SMTP

Supabase [now requires adding custom SMTP](https://github.com/orgs/supabase/discussions/29370) to your supabase project in order to avoid abuse of their system. Without adding a custom SMTP, your signup requests to your supabase project will fail. To avoid this, you should go to the [SMTP section](https://supabase.com/dashboard/project/_/settings/auth) of your supabase settings.

Make sure to toggle **Enable Custom SMTP** and fill in the following fields:

- Sender email
- Sender name
- SMTP host
- SMTP port
- SMTP username
- SMTP password

</Step>

<Step>
### Add configurations to your environment variables

Now with all these set up you need to get update the .env file in `apps/dashboard`. You need to update the following environment variables:

```bash
PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
PRIVATE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE=
```

To get the correct environment variables, follow the instructions in this image:

</Step>

<Step>
### Tada - That's all

Now you can run:

```bash
pnpm dev --filter=dashboard
```

- Open the url in your browser
- Click on Sign up
- And that's it...
