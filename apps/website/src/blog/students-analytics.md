_ClassroomIO Students Analytics_

As we end the year, we are excited to announce that we have added student analytics to our platform. This is a feature that we have been working on for a while and we are happy to finally launch it. With this new feature, you can better understand the progress of specific students in your course or your organisation.

## Audience Analytics

The audience page as you already know allows you to view the students in your **organisation**. With audience analytics, you can drill into each registered student of yours to understand the last time they logged in, all the courses they are enrolled in and the progress they have made.

## Course Student Analytics

Further more, when you go into any course and go to the people tab, you can view all the students currently enrolled in that course. With this new release, you can now also drill into each enrolled student to see their course progress. You can see:

- The last time they logged in
- The progress they have made in the course
- The average grade they have received in the course
- Their submitted assignments and the score they received

## What's Next?

We are working on adding more analytics to the platform to help you better understand what's going on in your organisation. You will know the coutries of your students, their overall performance and more.
