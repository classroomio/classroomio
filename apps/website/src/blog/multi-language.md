_ClassroomIO now supports 8 languages_

We are happy to share that within the ClassroomIO dashboard and your dedicated student dashboard we now support 8 languages including English. These 8 languages include:

1. English
2. French
3. German
4. Portugese
5. Spanish
6. Russian
7. Hindi
8. Vietnamese

The best thing about this feature is that you can have students from different countries use your LMS in any of the above languages without any extra effort on your end. This means that educators can create a localised experience for each student consuming their content from different countries around the world.

To change your language within the dashboard, you can go to the settings page by clicking your profile picture at the bottom left and select your preferred language in the drop down in the Profiles tab.

## We went a step further üòÅ

Now that our whole application is in 8 languages, that means you should be able to also add content for your courses in those languages right? YES YES YES. For customers creating international courses that can be consumed by people from different countries, this is a very crucial feature.

Well how does it work? You can go into the course builder, open a lesson you want to add content into and start typing. By default the content will be stored in English language. If you want to add content for another language, just change the language at the top right and start typing. ITS THAT SIMPLE

Oh we even hooked up our AI content generator with it as well, you can switch to any language and the AI will generate content for the specific lesson, in your selected language.

## Next steps

All translations in our app are stored in a JSON file which we generate and keep up to date using Google translate. This means that it might not be 100% accurate and there could be some mistakes when use  our dashboard in other languages. If you do find any issues with our translations, please do open an [issue on Github](https://github.com/classroomio/classroomio/issues/new/choose) with the correct translation and we'd be so happy to fix it.

If you are a native speaker of any of the 7 languages and want to contribute, please feel free to nitpick into our [translations](https://github.com/classroomio/classroomio/tree/main/apps/dashboard/src/lib/utils/translations) and open a PR with the fixes. Every contribution is valuable and will be gladly welcomed üòä
