_Rotimi Best at the 2 day EduAI Hub Summit held at the University of Lagos_

I was invited by [EduAI Hub](https://eduaihub.org/) to their 2 day summit at the University of Lagos to talk about the progress we've made as a company and how we are using AI in education.

A bit about EduAI Hub before I jump into my experience at the summit:

> The EduAI hub is an African based research network on responsible artificial intelligence innovations that seek to advance education across Africa.
>
> The EduAI hub is located within the University of Lagos main campus. The Hub network presently comprises the University of Lagos, UniversitÃ© dâ€™Abomey Calavi, in Benin Republic, and Data Science Nigeria (DSN).

### My experience

Now to my experience - __it was nothing less than amazing__.

I could see how the eyes of some of the educators lite up when I said we can allow them build a customisable alternative to Google Classroom without writing a single line of code. I spoke about the importance of a customisable no-code elearning platform that anyone could use to deploy their own learning management system that suits their brand. I also gave an analogy using Shopify and Wordpress, how Shopify is allowing businesses create ecommerce stores in minutes or Wordpress allowing writters and businesses create robust websites in minutes - that's exactly what we want to do in the educational space starting with bootcamps.

You can find my slides [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yU9EFmYA5OJ9PmM4vQp39100vryRBdz3fCAVLktrUEI/edit?usp=sharing)

This was my first actual event speaking about ClassroomIO and I was amazed by the amount of people that wanted to chat about how they could use the product for their online courses.

Apart from the talk, I met amazing people working on other edtech related products and how they also use AI to empower their users. 

### Unexpected learning

One interesting thing I discovered was that people found it much easier to remember our product's name because it included a familiar wordâ€”**Classroom**. All they had to do was add **IO** at the end! ðŸ˜ƒðŸ˜ƒ Compared to other projects that were demoed, our name actually stuck with the teachers. This was something I had initially overlooked, but now I realize how important a name can be in connecting with your audience.

Thanks to this summit and actually talking to real users, I know exactly some of the things we are missing and we will get them in ASAP.
