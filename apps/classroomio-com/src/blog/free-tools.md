_ClassroomIO Free Tools_

For a while now, we've been looking to build tools that will help educators and students be more productive. The only rule of thumb for every tool is that it must be FREE to use. I spent time conducting research, examining existing options, and talking to students. As a result, I came up with several tools that can help educators and students enhance their productivity.

We didn't build just 1 or 3, but 5 [FREE tools](/tools) available for anyone to try out. We've released them for a while now and have been receiving feedback. We will continue to improve them and enhance the user experience.

Here are the 5 tools we've built:

### 1. Progress Report

This tool allows students to share their learning progress with their peers. It is not only useful for students but for anyone learning anything at all. You can share your progress, add an avatar of your choice, and download an image that you can share on social media.

### 2. Pomodoro Timer

Pomodoro is, at this point, a pretty well-known tool. One of the things students find particularly useful is anything that helps them focus on getting things done, which the Pomodoro technique excels at. You simply add your to-do list, start the timer, and get to work. You can mark each to-do as done once you've completed the task. We also persist the data in your browser so that even after reloading the page, you don't lose your to-do list.

### 3. Random Name Picker

In a classroom setting, an educator might want to call on a student to solve a particular task or answer a question. Rather than manually deciding which student to pick, why not use a tool to help randomly select students to participate in your lesson? This approach can help avoid bias in selecting specific types of students and ensure fair participation across the class.

### 4. Activity Stopwatch

Live classes often include timed group activities where students are assigned tasks. With our stopwatch, you can now easily track these activities from one central location. Simply name your activity and set the desired duration. Once the time is up, you'll hear the stopwatch ringing, signaling the end of the activity.

### 5. Tic Tac Toe Game

This is my favorite because you can play with someone else. With our simple online Tic-Tac-Toe, you can either choose to play against the computer or physically play with someone else. If you're on a quick break or you want to have a little fun, you should come and try out this tool.
