Today I am happy to announce that we've added support for custom domains into our admin dashboard. Companies and Training organisations can now take advantage of this feature to strengthen their brand using our learning management system.

## Benefits of setting up a custom domain

1. Brand consistency. This means that your student platform won't be hosted on our free subdomain that we provide to you, instead they will be on your own brand domain like courses.yourdomain.com or training.yourdomain.com

2. Increased credibility: Using your custom domain lends more professionalism and legitimacy to your organisation. It shows that you have invested in your online presence, which can build trust with customers.

3. Improved user experience: Users can easily remember and access your service using your branded URL. It creates a seamless experience between your website and the SaaS application.

4. Better SEO: Custom domains can contribute to improved search engine optimization (SEO) for your brand. All traffic and links associated with the SaaS application will be attributed to your domain.

## Who has access to custom domains?

Custom domains are only available within our [Early Adopters plan](https://classroomio.com/pricing). This is our only paid plan for now except our enterprise plans. If you need a demo of the product or contemplating on whether this plan is right for you, please [schedule a demo with us](https://classroomio.com/demo).
