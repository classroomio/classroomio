# Login quickly with Demo Accounts

This guide will help you get started quickly once you setup our local environment and you want to start using the [dashboard](https://app.classroomio.com).

<Callout>
  The assumption of this guide is that you've gone through our README and you've setup `supabase`
  and you have `dashboard` running locally.

### Admin Login Credentials.

Once you have the `dashboard` service running locally and you have setup supabase, we added seed data that can allow you access an admin account to a demo organization and a student account to a student dashboard. This allows you see what ClassroomIO can do quickly without trying to figure it out.
