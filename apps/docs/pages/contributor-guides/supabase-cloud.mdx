## Step by Step guide

<Steps>

### Create a Supabase project

For this step you need to have signed up for supabase and create an account, just visit [supabase.com](https://supabase.com).

Once you have an account just click on the _New Project_ on your dashboard. After that you should see a similar screen to the below, fill in the fields.

<Callout>
  Make sure you save your database password somewhere, else you won't be able to get it back
  anywhere in the dashboard for security reasons.
</Callout>

### Login to Supabase via the CLI

Open your terminal and go to the root of the project. Run the following:

```bash copy
pnpm supabase login
```

Follow the instruction in your terminal to generate your access token. Paste the token in the console and hit **Enter**

### Push migrations to your Supabase project

- Go to the supabase dashboard, go to your project, click on the settings icon on the left side bar

<Image src={DBUrl} alt="DB URL in the supabase dashboard" quality="100" />

- Copy the URL in the image above for your `db url`
- Paste it somewhere
- In the url, replace `[YOUR PASSWORD]` with your db password (which you saved in section 1).
- Then run in your terminal:

```bash copy
pnpm supabase db push --db-url "URL HERE"
```

<Callout>
  Make sure you preserve the double quotes before and after the url. Only replace `URL HERE` with
  your `db url` that contains your password
</Callout>

#### Result

### Configure Auth in your Supabase project

Here we will update our email configurations, to prevent supabase from sending confirmation emails on signup. This is because we don't have email confirmation setup on ClassroomIO, this feature will come later. If you don't disable it, you won't be able to signup into the application.

### Add configurations to your environment variables

Now with all these set up you need to get update the .env file in `apps/dashboard`. You need to update the following environment variables:

```bash copy
PUBLIC_SUPABASE_PROJECT_REF=
PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
```

To get the correct environment variables, follow the instructions in this image

### Tada - That's all

Now you can run:

```bash copy
pnpm dev --filter=dashboard
```

- Open the url in your browser
- Click on Sign up
- And that's it ...
