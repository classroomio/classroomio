<Image src={SelfhostClassroomIO} alt="Selfhost ClassroomIO" quality="100" />

## Overview

In this page, you will be guided on how to configure supabase cloud, self host ClassroomIO, where to access environmental variables and how to deploy your application using our railway template, docker or your own custom servers

### Architecture

ClassroomIO follows a well structured monorepo file architecture but major components needed for development and deployment are:

- [apps/backend](https://github.com/rotimi-best/classroomio/tree/main/apps/backend) - Hono API server
- [apps/dashboard](https://github.com/rotimi-best/classroomio/tree/main/apps/dashboard) - SvelteKit admin dashboard + LMS
- [Supabase](https://github.com/rotimi-best/classroomio/tree/main/supabase) - PostgreSQL database + REST API

### Prerequisites

The following steps must be completed before deployment can be done

### 1. Supabase Cloud Setup (Required)

You need a fully configured Supabase Cloud project as your database. This is **mandatory** for all deployment methods.

**[Complete the Supabase Cloud Setup Guide →](/contributor-guides/supabase-cloud)**

After completing this guide, you'll have:

- Supabase project with all required tables
- Authentication configured
- SMTP email settings
- Environment variables ready

### 2. SMTP Configuration (Required)

Both Supabase and the backend need SMTP credentials for email functionality:

```bash
SMTP_HOST=your_smtp_host
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=your_smtp_username
SMTP_PASSWORD=your_smtp_password
SMTP_SENDER=your_sender_email
```

<Callout type="info">
  Learn more about setting up a custom SMTP server
  [here](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/auth/auth-smtp)
</Callout>

**Popular SMTP Providers:**

- **Gmail**(recommended): Use app-specific passwords
- **SendGrid**: Free tier available
- **Mailgun**: Developer-friendly
- **Your own SMTP server**

### 3. Cloudflare R2 (Optional)

All our videos and image assets are managed and uploaded on cloudfare for secure and fast retrieval in the courses. This variables are not required for the basic functionality but are recommended for a full experience.

```bash
# Optional - Cloudflare R2 for video uploads
CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID=your_account_id
CLOUDFLARE_ACCESS_KEY=your_access_key
CLOUDFLARE_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_key
# Optional: override bucket domain; derived from ACCOUNT_ID when omitted
CLOUDFLARE_BUCKET_DOMAIN=your_bucket_domain
```

<Callout type="info">The backend uses the bucket name "videos" by default.</Callout>

   You can manually create an .env file or use the command below to quickly create both .env files needed.

```bash
   cp apps/backend/.env.example .env
   cp apps/dashboard/.env.example .env
```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**:
   Edit both `.env` files in the dashboard and backend with your Supabase, SMTP credentials and other optional variables.

4. **Start Services**:
   ```bash
   docker compose up --build -d
   ```

### Service Configuration

The docker-compose file sets up two services:

#### Backend Service (cio-backend)

- **Port**: 3002
- **Image**: Node.js 18-alpine
- **Features**: API endpoints, file uploads, email notifications
- **Dependencies**: Supabase, SMTP, Cloudflare R2 (optional)

#### Dashboard Service (cio-dashboard)

- **Port**: 3000
- **Image**: Node.js 18-alpine
- **Features**: Web interface, course management, user dashboard
- **Dependencies**: Supabase, backend connection

### Docker Commands

If you are not really familiar with docker, here are some quick docker commands for you.

```bash
# Start services in detached mode
docker compose up -d

# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# Stop services
docker compose down

# Rebuild and restart in detached mode
docker compose up --build -d

curl http://localhost:3000
```

#### 3. Backup Strategy

Create a plan to protect your application and data from loss. Regular backups ensure you can recover quickly from hardware failures or other disasters.

```bash
# Database backups (Supabase handles this)
# Application backups
tar -czf classroomio-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d).tar.gz classroomio/

# Environment files backup
cp apps/backend/.env apps/backend/.env.backup
cp apps/dashboard/.env apps/dashboard/.env.backup
```

#### 4. Performance Optimization

Implement techniques to make your application faster and more efficient under load. These optimizations help handle multiple users simultaneously without slowing down.

```bash
# Enable PM2 clustering
pm2 start dist/index.js --name "cio-backend" -i max
pm2 start build --name "cio-dashboard" -i max

# Nginx caching
# Add to Nginx config for static assets
location ~* \.(js|css|png|jpg|jpeg|gif|ico|svg)$ {
    expires 1y;
    add_header Cache-Control "public, immutable";
}
```

### Deployment Verification

Test that everything is working correctly after deployment. These checks confirm your application is accessible, healthy, and properly configured before users start using it.

```bash
# Check services are running
pm2 status
pm2 logs --lines 50

# Test endpoints
curl -I http://localhost:3000
curl -I http://localhost:3002/health

# Check Nginx status
sudo systemctl status nginx
sudo nginx -t

# Verify SSL certificate
sudo certbot certificates
```

### Troubleshooting Commands

Use these tools to diagnose and fix common problems in production. When things go wrong, these commands help you quickly identify the issue and get your application running again.

```bash
# View PM2 logs
pm2 logs cio-backend
pm2 logs cio-dashboard

# Restart services
pm2 restart cio-backend
pm2 restart cio-dashboard

# Check Nginx logs
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/error.log

# Check system resources
htop
df -h
free -h
```

### Maintenance and Updates

Establish a routine to keep your application secure, up-to-date, and running smoothly. Regular maintenance ensures your app stays secure, performs well, and benefits from new features and bug fixes.

```bash
# Update application
cd classroomio
git pull origin main
cd apps/backend && pnpm install && pnpm run build
cd ../dashboard && pnpm install && pnpm run build
