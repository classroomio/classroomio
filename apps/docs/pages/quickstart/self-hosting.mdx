This guide will help you quickly selfhost ClassroomIO

<Image src={SelfhostClassroomIO} alt="Selfhost ClassroomIO" quality="100" />

ClassroomIO is made up of the following applications

- [apps/backend](https://github.com/rotimi-best/classroomio/tree/main/apps/backend) - an Express server
- [apps/dashboard](https://github.com/rotimi-best/classroomio/tree/main/apps/dashboard) - the admin dashboard + LMS
- [supabase](https://github.com/rotimi-best/classroomio/tree/main/supabase) - the database + REST API.

The quickest and easiest way to deploy both the backend and dashboard is by using our [Railway Template](https://railway.app/template/dl9RG7?referralCode=8OyIj5). However there are a couple of things that you'd need first before heading over to the template, which are:

1. SMTP values - For sending emails on the backend
2. Supabase - For the database used on the dashboard
3. Cloudflare R2 (optional) - Video uploads on the backend

## SMTP Setup

Both for the supabase and backend setup, you'd need a custom SMTP for email sending. Most importantly you need these values:

```bash
SMTP_HOST=
SMTP_PORT=
SMTP_USER=
SMTP_PASSWORD=
SMTP_SENDER=
```

Make sure you have them handy because you'd need them while we go through this selfhosting guide.

## Supabase

There are 2 options to go about setting up Supabase, you could [selfhost supabase](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/self-hosting) on your own servers or you could use their cloud version. We recommend you use the cloud version because it has a very generous free tier and you get to deploy it very quickly.

We have a standalone guide to help you setup your Supabase Cloud and you can find it [here](https://classroomio.com/docs/contributor-guides/supabase-cloud)

After you go through that guide you will need the following environment variables, please also store them somewhere:

```bash
PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
PRIVATE_SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE=
```

## Cloudflare R2

We use Cloudflare R2 for video uploading within the course builder. It is not required though and you can do without it in the app if you don't need video upload.

## Using Docker

We provide a docker-compose configuration to deploy both the backend and dashboard services. Here's how to use it:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rotimi-best/classroomio.git
cd classroomio
```

2. Create a `.env` file with your environment variables (see Environment Variables section above)

3. Start the services:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

The services will be available at:

- Dashboard: http://localhost:3000
- Backend: http://localhost:3002

### Service Configuration

The docker-compose file sets up two services:

#### Backend Service

- Runs on port 3002
- Uses Node.js slim image
- Mounts the backend code directory
- Requires environment variables for:
  - Supabase configuration
  - Cloudflare R2 for video uploads
  - SMTP for email notifications

#### Dashboard Service

- Runs on port 3000
- Uses Node.js Alpine image
- Uses pnpm for package management
- Requires environment variables for:
  - Supabase configuration
  - Application settings
  - Optional API keys (OpenAI, Unsplash)

Note: We're currently working on including Supabase in the docker-compose file. If you'd like to help with this, please open a PR on GitHub! üëç
