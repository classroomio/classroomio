# Signing Up for ClassroomIO

Signing up is currently disabled on production. Potential customers can only book a demo or try out our local setup.

## Signing up locally.

This assumption of this section is that you already have ClassroomIO setup locally.

To sign up do the following.

<Steps>
### Start the application locally

To get the application running locally, you should run this at the root of the project:

```js
pnpm dev --filter=dashboard
```

This will only startup the dashboard which powers all of the learning management features.
