 * <p>This implementation of the DELETE action uses the policy subresource to delete the
 *          policy of a specified bucket. If you are using an identity other than the root user of the
 *          Amazon Web Services account that owns the bucket, the calling identity must have the
 *             <code>DeleteBucketPolicy</code> permissions on the specified bucket and belong to the
 *          bucket owner's account to use this operation. </p>
 *          <p>If you don't have <code>DeleteBucketPolicy</code> permissions, Amazon S3 returns a <code>403
 *             Access Denied</code> error. If you have the correct permissions, but you're not using an
 *          identity that belongs to the bucket owner's account, Amazon S3 returns a <code>405 Method Not
 *             Allowed</code> error. </p>
 *          <important>
 *             <p>To ensure that bucket owners don't inadvertently lock themselves out of their own
 *             buckets, the root principal in a bucket owner's Amazon Web Services account can perform the
 *                <code>GetBucketPolicy</code>, <code>PutBucketPolicy</code>, and
 *                <code>DeleteBucketPolicy</code> API actions, even if their bucket policy explicitly
 *             denies the root principal's access. Bucket owner root principals can only be blocked from performing
 *             these API actions by VPC endpoint policies and Amazon Web Services Organizations policies.</p>
 *          </important>
 *          <p>For more information about bucket policies, see <a href="https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-iam-policies.html">Using Bucket Policies and
 *             UserPolicies</a>. </p>

 * ```javascript

 * // const { S3Client, DeleteBucketPolicyCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-s3"); // CommonJS import
 * const client = new S3Client(config);
 * const input = { // DeleteBucketPolicyRequest
 *   Bucket: "STRING_VALUE", // required
 *   ExpectedBucketOwner: "STRING_VALUE",
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteBucketPolicyCommand(input);
 * const response = await client.send(command);
 * // {};
 *
 * ```
 *
 * @param DeleteBucketPolicyCommandInput - {@link DeleteBucketPolicyCommandInput}
 * @returns {@link DeleteBucketPolicyCommandOutput}
 * @see {@link DeleteBucketPolicyCommandInput} for command's `input` shape.
 * @see {@link DeleteBucketPolicyCommandOutput} for command's `response` shape.
 * @see {@link S3ClientResolvedConfig | config} for S3Client's `config` shape.
 *
 * @throws {@link S3ServiceException}
 * <p>Base exception class for all service exceptions from S3 service.</p>
 *
 * @example To delete bucket policy
 * ```javascript
 * // The following example deletes bucket policy on the specified bucket.
 * const input = {
 *   "Bucket": "examplebucket"
 * };
 * const command = new DeleteBucketPolicyCommand(input);
 * await client.send(command);
