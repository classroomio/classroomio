I am building a LMS for teachers and students to collaborate on a course. Students can enroll in a course or be giving access to a course. Teachers can be invited into an org by an admin to create courses and manage students. For auth we support Email/Password and Google.

The tech stack is
- Sveltekit - dashboard (teacher view) and lms (student view)
- Supabase - Auth, DB requests, Storage
- Hono - API for long running processes like video uploads
```
