### The Four Quadrants of Time Management

Based on Stephen Covey's framework, activities can be categorized into:

1. **Urgent & Important** (Crises, pressing problems)
2. **Not Urgent but Important** (Planning, prevention, relationship building)
3. **Urgent but Not Important** (Interruptions, some calls)
4. **Not Urgent & Not Important** (Time wasters, pleasant activities)
